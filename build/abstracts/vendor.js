/**
 * @remarks
 * Base class of all Vendors for Swivel HOCs. This abstraction should only
 * contain the Methods and properties needed by Swivel HOCs to function.
 * Note that we are referring to third party libs such as Ethers and Web3 as <TODO>
 * The Vendor, in turn, keeps a reference to it's own .provider specific to that lib.
 * While this is natural to me, it may be worth discussing different terms if confusing.
